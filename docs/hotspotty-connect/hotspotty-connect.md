# Hotspotty Connect

Hotspotty Connect is a mobile application developed by Hotspotty and can be used to onboard hotspots to the Helium network, to message other hotspot owners, to view your helium earnings and so much more.

Hotspotty Connect is completely free to download for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hotspottyconnect) and [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/hotspotty-connect/id1622212036).

## Initial setup

1. Install Hotspotty Connect for your device.
2. Get started by linking a wallet to the app. This can either be done manually or by linking it via the [Helium Wallet App](https://blog.helium.com/helium-wallet-app-now-available-for-download-b25e9c7ebedd) deeplink functionality. (For now you still have the option to link your wallet via the Helium Hotspot App as well.)
