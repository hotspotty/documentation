## What is the host dashboard?

The host dashboard basically allows contacts (that have an email address associated to them) in 1/+ workspace(s) to login to a portal where they can have an overview of all the data that is associated to them.


## How to enable the host dashboard?

**There are 2 prerequisites before contacts can make use of the host dashboard:**
 - The workspace needs to have the business plan.
 - The host dashboard needs to be activated in the workspace settings.

1. Click on workspace.
2. Go over to your workspace settings.
3. Click on '[Host Dashboard](https://app.hotspotty.net/workspace/settings/host-dashboard)'
4. Activate the host dashboard by clicking the toggle button.

## How to use the host dashboard?
1. Navigate to https://host.hotspotty.net/.
2. Login by entering your email address.
3. Enter the verification code that is sent to your email.

:::note
- An email verification code only gets sent if the entered email address is in fact associated to a contact in a workspace and the host dashboard is activated for that workspace.

- The login code expires after 60 seconds.
:::

On the top, you can switch between the workspaces you are in as a contact. Keep in mind that only workspaces that have the host dashboard option activated will be visible to you.

For each workspace, you'll find info about the contact, attached commissions, registered payments and internal messages. 

All this data is view-only and cannot be edited through the host dashboard. It can only be edited via https://app.hotspotty.net/ by [workspace members](../features/monitoring-and-managing/settings/#members).

Each hotspot that is linked to a commission of the contact is also shown on the map and indicated with a colored dot.
