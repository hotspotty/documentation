# Optimize your earnings and transmit scale

Helium uses a grid system of hexagons to bucket and analyze network coverage. This is to ensure, among other things, an even spread of the ‘people powered network’ globally.

The grid system consists of seven layers of hexagons. The individual hexagon layers are called resolutions. Each hexagon layer has an optimal amount of hotspots, which varies based on the hotspot density in the neighboring hexagons.

The reward factors and transmission scale are negatively affected when a hexagon exceeds the optimal number of hotspots. For example, in densely populated areas such as New York and London, the amount of registered hotspots per hexagon by far exceeds the optimal hotspot number per hexagon determined by Helium. This in turn results in a terrible reward factor in these locations and thus, almost eliminates the HNT earning potential for the network providers in the areas.
