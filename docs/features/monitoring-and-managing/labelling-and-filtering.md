# Labelling and filters

You can add a range of combinable labels to make it easier to search hotspots, wallets, contacts, locations and installs across your portfolio.

## Labelling and filters via workspace

Wallets, Hotspots, Locations, Contacts and Installs have label and filter options in your workspace.

Let's take the Hotspots tab as an example. In the **label** column, you can add labels. At the top you can afterwards **filter** for a specific label.

Go over to the **settings** tab to have a list of all your created labels. From there, you can create labels for every single feature without going to the specific tab.

### Filter hotspots by wallet address and hotspot id
Easily filter through your list of hotspots by searching for the wallet address your hotspots are attached to or search for a specific hotspot id which is unique for every single unit.

The image below shows an example of a hotspot id and wallet address.

### Edit and remove labels

Did you make a typo, do you want to change the color of your label or do you want to completely remove a label from your workspace? Go over to the **Labels** section in your workspace that is located under the **Settings** tab. Next to each label name you can find the type, usage amount and actions column. By clicking on the 3 dots <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="-3 -3 26 26" className="los-icon" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M10 6a2 2 0 110-4 2 2 0 010 4zM10 12a2 2 0 110-4 2 2 0 010 4zM10 18a2 2 0 110-4 2 2 0 010 4z"></path></svg> in the actions column next to the label you want to edit or remove, you will find the ability to edit/remove a label.
