# Workspaces

Workspaces give you access to a dedicated environment where you can manage your hotspot deployments. You can use it to structure and organize your own hotspots, or [invite team members](./settings#members) with a paid plan to collaborate with others on the same workspace data. Each workspace has a [subscription plan](/pricing), which defaults to the free **Hotspotty Community** plan.

You can create or join multiple workspaces from a single Hotspotty account. However, you can **only** have one workspace with the **Hotspotty Community** plan.

## Delete a workspace

Please take a look at [this](/FAQ/delete-workspace) FAQ article.
