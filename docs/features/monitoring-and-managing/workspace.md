# Workspaces

Workspaces give you access to a dedicated environment where you can manage your hotspot deployments. You can use it to structure and organize your own hotspots, or [invite team members](./settings#members) with a paid plan to collaborate with others on the same workspace data. Each workspace has a [subscription plan](/pricing), which defaults to the free **Hotspotty Community** plan.

You can create or join multiple workspaces from a single Hotspotty account. However, you can **only** have one workspace with the **Hotspotty Community** plan.

## Delete a workspace
1. Go over to your [workspace settings](https://app.hotspotty.net/workspace/settings/danger-zone) by either clicking on workspace > settings or by clicking on your workspace name in the upper right corner of the Hotspotty app followed by the gear icon.
