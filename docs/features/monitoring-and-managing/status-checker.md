# Hotspot status and diagnostics
The [Light Hotspot transition](https://blog.helium.com/light-hotspots-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-f86612f571c6?gi=4441c20e2b76) continues with an [upgrade released on 14 jul. 2022](https://engineering.helium.com/2022/07/14/miner-hotspot-release.html), and solves many problems by making things simpler for hotspots ("relayed" and "syncing" statuses become obsolete).

With the [upgrade to Light Hotspots](https://blog.helium.com/light-hotspots-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-f86612f571c6), we no longer have access to the IP address to ping the hotspot for real time status checking. We are working directly with hotspot Makers on an integration that brings real-time hotspot diagnostics back to Hotspotty. Please ask your hotspot Maker for this integration so we can bring you a better diagnostics experience. More information [here](https://blog.hotspotty.net/maker-partnership-program/).



# Live diagnostics status for RAK/MNTD

The remote hotspot diagnostics information below is brought to you trough the Cal-Chip API integration as part of the Hotspotty Maker Partnership Program and was retrieved directly from the hotspot 2 hours ago. This section gives you information about the connectivity of the miner, the hardware and software. This info can be easily retrieved by clicking on a hotspot and choosing the 'Show diagnostics' button on the status page.

Under the live diagnostics, you can still monitor whether the hotspot is active or not.
