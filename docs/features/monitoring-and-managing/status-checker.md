# Hotspot status and diagnostics
The [Light Hotspot transition](https://blog.helium.com/light-hotspots-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-f86612f571c6?gi=4441c20e2b76) continues with an [upgrade released on 14 jul. 2022](https://engineering.helium.com/2022/07/14/miner-hotspot-release.html), and solves many problems by making things simpler for hotspots ("relayed" and "syncing" statuses become obsolete).

With the [upgrade to Light Hotspots](https://blog.helium.com/light-hotspots-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-f86612f571c6), we no longer have access to the IP address to ping the hotspot for real time status checking. We are working directly with hotspot Makers on an integration that brings real-time hotspot diagnostics back to Hotspotty. Please ask your hotspot Maker for this integration so we can bring you a better diagnostics experience.
