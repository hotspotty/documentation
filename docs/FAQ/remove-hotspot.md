# How can I remove a hotspot from my workspace?
If you manually added a hotspot to your workspace, you can simply check out following article to remove the hotspot from your workspace: [remove manually added hotspot](../features/visualize-and-understand/manage-hotspots/#remove-hotspots).

If the hotspot is added to your workspace because you imported the hotspot **via a wallet**, you'll have to either delete the wallet from your workspace or you simply stop tracking hotspots for this linked wallet.

## Option 1: Stop tracking hotspots for a wallet
1. Go over to your workspace.

2. Click [**Wallets**](https://app.hotspotty.net/workspace/wallets).
3. Click on the 3 dots <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="-3 -3 26 26" className="los-icon" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M10 6a2 2 0 110-4 2 2 0 010 4zM10 12a2 2 0 110-4 2 2 0 010 4zM10 18a2 2 0 110-4 2 2 0 010 4z"></path></svg> next to the desired wallet that has the hotspot attached.
4. Click **Stop tracking hotspots**.

You can now remove the hotspot as you would for a manual added hotspot.
