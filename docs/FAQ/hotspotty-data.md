# Where does Hotspotty get its data from?

Hotspotty doesn't pull any data from the Helium API, we run our own node of the helium blockchain, everything runs on our own infrastructure. The system is split into the blockchain data and the hotspotty data. The blockchain data provides information regarding rewards, hotspots, wallets, Proof-Of-Coverage etc. Our system has the full management, profit/payment/commission calculations, contact management and communication and much more.
