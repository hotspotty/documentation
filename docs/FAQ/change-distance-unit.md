# How can I change the distance unit?

Hotspotty includes distances in many of its features. You can choose whether these are displayed in **Metric (m)** or **Imperial (ft)** units.

You can configure your preference in the [appearance settings](../features/planning-and-optimizing/appearance-settings.md) (the gear icon at the top right of the screen wherever you are in the Hotspotty app).
