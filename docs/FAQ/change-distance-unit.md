# How can I change the distance unit?
Distance units can be found all over Hotspotty. Through the appearance settings, you can choose whether these are displayed in Metric(m) or Imperial(ft).

You can change your preference in the [appearance settings](../features/planning-and-optimizing/appearance-settings.md) (the gear icon at the top right of the screen wherever you are in the Hotspotty app).
