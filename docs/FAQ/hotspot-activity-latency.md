# Why do I sometimes get to see different hotspot info on Hotspotty than what the Helium explorer shows?

Active, Online/Offline, Relayed is something not existing anymore in the blockchain with the Light Hotspots. Helium is not the source of thruth when it comes to blockchain data. The whole system works with each node of the blockchain whispering to each other. Which means that sometimes hotspotty is ahead of helium and sometimes helium is ahead of hotspotty.
