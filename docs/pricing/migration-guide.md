# Free to freemium migration guide

Hotspotty will go live with its freemium model on **April 2nd, 2022**, which puts an end to the unlimited and free beta version that was launched mid August 2021. This document is meant to outline our new commercial offering and elaborate on some specific use cases.

## Pricing

### Existing workspaces within Hotspotty Community limits

In this case, no action is required for users that are happy to stay in the **Community plan**. Their workspace will automatically be converted to this plan.

### Existing workspaces exceeding the Hotspotty Community limits

In this case, there are three options:

1. Upgrade the workspace to a paid plan (Plus, Business or Enterprise)
2. Remove whatever exceeds the limits (hotspots, locations, team members). This needs to be done before the billing is launched on April 2nd, 2022
3. Delete the workspace

### Users with multiple workspaces

A user can have at most one workspace with the Community base plan.

Users that have multiple workspaces will have to go through scenario 2 for each workspace until there is only one workspace left with one Community base plan.

From April 2nd, 2022 onwards, workspaces that do not meet the above requirements will have limited access to its resources.
