# Free to freemium migration guide

Hotspotty goes live with the freemium offering on **April 2nd, 2022**, ending the unlimited and free beta version that was launched mid August 2021. This document helps you prepare for these changes. Please consult the [pricing page](./pricing.md) to learn more about the different plans. **It is important to understand that everything billing-related is defined at a workspace level.**

## Users with just one workspace

### Up to 1 hotspots and up to 2 locations

No action is required. The workspace will automatically transition to the free **community** plan that includes 1 hotspot, 2 locations, and 1 super simulation per month.

### More than 1 hotspot and/or more than 2 locations

The workspace will automatically transition the free **community** plan that includes 1 hotspot, 2 locations and 1 super simulation per month.
This means that you will no longer be able to see more than 1 hotspot and/or more than 2 locations in your workspace.

To continue managing all your hotspots and locations, you are asked to upgrade your workspace to either **pro** or **business** plan. To the chosen plan, you will also need to add the desired number of hotspots and/or simulations you want to use per month. Every hotspot or simulation added to the plan will automatically come with two locations.

If you do not want to upgrade to a paid plan, you should delete the extra hotspots and/or locations so that your data fits in the **community** plan. Note that you can not delete hotspots or locations that are linked to installs, as that would corrupt your data. So if you still want to proceed with deletion, you should first delete the linked installs.

### External team members (yourself + others)

The **community** and **pro** plans do not support collaboration between multiple team members per workspace.
The **business** plan allows up to 10 team members per workspace.

So if your workspace has multiple team members, you have two options:

1. Upgrade your workspace to the **business** plan
2. Remove all other team members (except yourself)

In case you do not act before the 2nd of April, the workspace will be locked except for the settings tab so you can move forward with one of the options above.

## Users with multiple workspaces

At most one **community** workspace per user is allowed.
On top of your **community** workspace, you can have or be invited to unlimited paid workspaces.

In the case of multiple workspaces before the 2nd of April, you have two options:

1. Upgrade workspaces to the **pro** or **business** plans until you have only one **community** workspace left
2. Delete workspaces until you have only one **community** workspace left

In case you do not act before the 2nd of April, the oldest workspace will transition to the **community** plan and your additional workspaces will be locked except for the settings tab so you can move forward with migration steps above.
