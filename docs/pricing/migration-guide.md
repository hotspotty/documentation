### Existing workspaces within the Community plan limits

In this case, no action is required for users that are happy to stay in the **Community plan**. Their workspace will automatically be converted to this plan.

### Existing workspaces exceeding the the Community plan limits

If your workspace has more than one hotspot, two locations or one team member, you will no longer have the complete functionalities available because the workspace exceeds the Community plan limits.

In this case, there are three options:

1. Upgrade the workspace to a matching paid plan on April 2nd (Plus, Business or Enterprise feature plan and add the desired number of hotspots and/or super simulations)
2. Remove whatever exceeds the limits (hotspots, locations, team members). This needs to be done before the billing is launched on April 2nd, 2022
3. Delete the workspace

### Users with multiple workspaces

A user can have at most one workspace with the Community plan.

Users that have multiple workspaces will have to go through the above steps for each workspace until there is only one workspace left with one Community plan.

From April 2nd, 2022 onwards, workspaces that do not meet the above requirements will have limited access to its resources.
