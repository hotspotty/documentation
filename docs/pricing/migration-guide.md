# Free to freemium migration guide

Hotspotty goes live with the freemium offering on **April 2nd, 2022**, ending the unlimited and free beta version that was launched mid August 2021. This document helps you prepare for these changes. Please consult the [pricing page](./pricing.md) to learn more about the pricing.

## Users with just one workspace

### Up to 1 hotspots and up to 2 locations

No action required. The workspace will automatically get the free **community** feature plan, which includes 1 hotpspot, 2 locations and 1 super simulation per month.

### More than 1 hotspot and/or more than 2 locations

The workspace will automatically get the free **community** feature plan, which includes 1 hotpspot, 2 locations and 1 super simulation per month.
This means that you will no longer be able to see more than 1 hotspot and/or more than 2 locations in your workspace.

In order to keep managing all your hotspots and locations, you will need to upgrade your workspace to the **pro** or **business** plan and add the required number of hotspots and/or simulations per month. Per hotspot or simulation that you pay for, you automatically get twice as many locations for your workspace.

If you do not want to upgrade your workspace, you should delete the extra hotspots and/or locations so that your data fits in the **community** plan. Note that you can not delete hotspots or locations that are linked to installs, as that would corrupt your data. So if you still want to proceed with deletion, you should first delete the linked installs.

### External team members (yourself + others)

The **community** and **pro** plans do not support multiple team members per workspace.
The **business** plan allows up to 10 team members per workspace.

So if your workspace has multiple team members you have two options:

1. Upgrade your workspace to the **business** plan
2. Remove the other team members (except yourself)

In case you do not do act before the 2nd of April, the workspace will be locked except for the settings tab so you can move forward with one of the options above.

## Users with multiple workspaces

At most one **community** workspace per user is allowed.
On top of your **community** workspace, you can have or be invited to unlimited **pro** and **business** workspaces.

In this case, there are three options if you have multiple workspaces before the 2nd of April:

1. Upgrade workspaces to the **pro** or **business** plans until you have only one **community** workspace left
2. Delete workspaces until you have only one **community** workspace left

In case you do not do act before the 2nd of April, the oldest workspace will have to the **community** plan and the other workspaces will be locked except for the settings tab so you can move forward with migration steps above.
