# Free to freemium migration guide

Hotspotty will go live with its freemium model on **Mar 15th, 2022**, which puts an end to the unlimited and free beta version that was launched mid August 2021. This document is meant to outline our new commercial offering and elaborate on some specific use cases.

## Pricing

Please consult the [pricing page](./pricing.md) to learn more about the pricing.

### Existing workspaces within Hotspotty Community limits

In this case, no action is required for users that are happy to stay in the Hotspotty Community plan. Their workspace will automatically be converted to this plan.

### Existing workspaces exceeding the Hotspotty Community limits

In this case, there are three options:

1. Upgrade the workspace to a paid plan (Hotspotty Plus, Pro or Max)
2. Remove whatever exceeds the limits (hotspots, locations, team members). This needs to be done before the billing is launched on Mar 1, 2022
3. Delete the workspace

### Users with multiple workspaces

A user can have at most one workspace with the Hotspotty Community base plan.

Users that have multiple workspaces will have to go through scenario 2 for each workspace until there is only one workspace left with the Hotspotty Community base plan.

From Mar 1, 2022 onwards, the workspaces that do not meet the above requirements will be locked and will require manual processing if you want to reactivate them.
