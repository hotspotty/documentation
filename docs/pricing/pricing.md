# Pricing

Most features in Hotspotty are free to use, however the freemium model there introduces some limitations. Additional features and increased limits are available through paid subscription plans.

**Everything billing-related is defined at a workspace level.** So if you have a workspace with multiple team members collaborating, the billing details are configured for the entire workspace and not for each individual member.

This also means that you can be part of multiple workspaces that each have a different subscription plan.
