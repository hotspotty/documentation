# Pricing

Most features in Hotspotty are free to use but with the implementation of the freemium model there will be some limitations. Extra features and increased limits are available through paid subscription plans.

Please go to our [pricing page](https://app.hotspotty.net/pricing) to sign up for your Hotspotty plan or manage your existing plan in the billing settings page.

## Workspaces

Everything billing-related is defined at a workspace level. So if you have a workspace with multiple team members collaborating, the billing details are configured for the entire workspace and not for each individual member.

This also means that you can be part of multiple workspaces that each have a different subscription plan associated with it.

## Base subscription plan

Each workspace needs to have one of the four base subscription plans:

- Community (FREE)
- Pro
- Business
- Enterprise

**Community** is the default for each workspace, and is free of charge but limited in use.

The Pro, Business and Enterprise plans come with a monthly subscription fee that grants an expanded feature set.

For the Community plan, the only way to surpass these limits is to upgrade to a paid base subscription plan. For the paid subscription plans, you can add as many hotspots as you need to your workspace. The main difference from the paid plans are in the feature you get with them.

## Volume discounts

Users can benefit from volume discounts by purchasing hotspots and simulations on a monthy plan. These amount of paid hotspots and simulations reset after every month, meaning that it is not possible to stack up and rollover to the following month.
