# Pricing

Most features in Hotspotty are free to use, however the freemium model there introduces some limitations. Additional features and increased limits are available through paid subscription plans.

Please go to our [pricing page](https://app.hotspotty.net/pricing) to sign up for your Hotspotty plan or manage your existing plan in the billing settings page.

## Workspaces

Everything billing-related is defined at a workspace level. So if you have a workspace with multiple team members collaborating, the billing details are configured for the entire workspace and not for each individual member.

This also means that you can be part of multiple workspaces that each have a different subscription plan.

## Base subscription plan

Each workspace needs to have one of the following feature subscription plans:

- Community (FREE)
- Pro
- Business
- Enterprise

**Community** is the default for each workspace, and is free of charge but limited in use (1 hotspot, 1 super simulation and 2 locations).

The Pro, Business and Enterprise plans come with a monthly subscription fee that grants an expanded feature set.

For the Community plan, the only way to surpass these limits is to upgrade to a paid feature plan. For each of the paid plans, you can add as many hotspots and/or super simulations as you need to your workspace. The difference between the paid plans is the features you get with them and access to the workspace (team members).

## Volume discounts

Users can benefit from volume discounts by purchasing hotspots and simulations on a monthy plan. These amount of paid hotspots and simulations reset after every month, meaning that it is not possible to stack up and rollover to the following month.
