# Appearance settings

Hotspotty gives you tons of customizable settings to choose from so that you can make Hotspotty look the way you prefer.

For almost every different page, you have other appearance settings to choose from. The options are hidden under the settings ⚙️ icon in the upper right corner. Some options require strong computer resources, which can cause the website to respond a bit slower after enabling some options. Therefore, we recommend that you test out for yourself what works best for you.

No matter what page you are looking at, the **theme**, **distance unit** and **currency** are changeable from everywhere.

![DOCS](/img/expand-the-network/standard-appearance-settings.png)

**Theme**: Use system settings, Light, Dark

**Distance unit**: Metric (m), Imperial (ft)

**Currency**: HNT, USD, EURO, GBP, CAD, AUD, BRL, JPY, DKK, SEK, CHF, INR, CNY, MYR, SGD, NZD, BTC, ETH

## Customize the Hotspotty map

Head over to the [Hotspotty app landing page](https://app.hotspotty.net/hotspots). There are lots of options to choose from here.

### Layers
#### Problematic hexes
These [hexes](../expand-the-network/evaluate-hotspot-locations#hexes) lower the transmit scale as their limits are exceeded.

:::tip
A low transmit scale is not beneficial to generate the optimal HNT revenue. [Read more about optimizing your earnings](../expand-the-network/optimize-your-earnings-and-reward-scaling).

#### Too close to witness 
Hotspots/locations that are too close to each other will not be rewarded for witnessing each other. These connections can be displayed by red lines. Hotspots located within 300 metres from each other are too close to witness and will not receive rewards for that type.

#### Witness lines
Show/hide lines for hotspot witnesses. More info is on the hotspot witnesses tab. By enabling one of the witness options, the lines will visualize that information. Please see the [witness tab](../getting-started/hotspot-status#witnesses) for this.

#### Elevation contours
Contour lines show vertical dimension on a region by joining points of equal elevation. This makes it convenient (2D) to visually identify topological obstructions between hotspots/locations which can block coverage. It also identifies opportunities for better coverage by identifying hills.

#### Hotspots
Hide hotspots for distraction free location planning.

:::note
This option is only available when you go over to the [Hexes](https://app.hotspotty.net/hexes) or [Locations](https://app.hotspotty.net/locations) tab on the Hotspotty map.
:::

:::note
The [Contacts](https://app.hotspotty.net/contacts) tab on the Hotspotty map allows hotspots to be displayed that are currently installed at locations of your (filtered) contacts.

The [Installs](https://app.hotspotty.net/installs) tab on the Hotspotty map allows hotspots to be displayed for your (filtered) installs.
:::

#### Locations
Locations allow managing and simulating potential places where hotspots can be installed at. Currently the only available metric for coloring locations is the [simulated transmit scale](../getting-started/hotspot-status#transmit-scale-simulation). Locations disabled for transmit scale simulations are grey.

#### Satellite view
Add a satellite view overlay to the map.

### Relative performance
Choose a metric to visualize the relative performance of hotspots. [More info can be found here](../getting-started/understand-your-area-and-account-verification)

## Customize your Hotspotty workspace
Workspaces do not have special appearance settings next to the default ones. But almost all tabs shown in the workspace have 3 dots <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="-3 -3 26 26" class="los-icon" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M10 6a2 2 0 110-4 2 2 0 010 4zM10 12a2 2 0 110-4 2 2 0 010 4zM10 18a2 2 0 110-4 2 2 0 010 4z"></path></svg> that allow for editing the columns with metrics to your needs.
