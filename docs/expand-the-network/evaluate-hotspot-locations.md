# Evaluate hotspot locations
 
## Transmit scale
Transmit scale is a multiplier that is applied to rewards of any Hotspot that witness you. The scale also affects how many rewards you receive as a Challengee. The number is a representation of how dense a hexagon is (how many Hotspots occupy that hex) at various resolutions (from resolution 12 down to resolution 4).

The only way to affect the scale is to move your hotspot somewhere less dense, or somehow remove the hotspots around you.
