# Labelling and filters
You can add a range of combinable labels to make it easier to search hotspots, wallets, contacts, locations and installs across your portfolio.

## Labelling and filters via workspace

Wallets, Hotspots, Locations, Contacts and Installs have label and filter options in your workspace.

Let's take the Hotspots tab as an example. In the **label** column, you can add labels. At the top you can afterwards **filter** for a specific label.

Go over to the **settings** tab to have a list of all your created labels. From there, you can create labels for every single feature without going to the specific tab.
