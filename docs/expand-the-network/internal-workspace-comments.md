# Internal workspace comments
Comments can be added to Hotspots, Locations, Contacts and installs via the Hotspotty map.

Let's demonstrate internal workspace comments by adding information to a hotspot.

Use the comments section to save text information relevant to this hotspot. For example, “need to move from window to rooftop”. Tagging other workspace members using the @ sign emails them the comment which is great for collaboration.

:::note
Comments can't be used for contacting other hotspot owners. The "[Contact owner](../expand-the-network/contact-hotspot-owner)" tab serves that purpose. Only you and people added to your workspace can view the comments.
