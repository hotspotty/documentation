# Contact hotspot owner

Letting people contact you is a great way to improve the overall quality of the Helium network. Maybe someone wants to collaborate with you or wants to help you [improve your reward scale](../expand-the-network/optimize-your-earnings-and-reward-scaling)?
Or what if you are the person willing to help someone out?


## How to get contacted?

Verify your HNT wallet so that Hotspotty knows you are a human üòÄ and not a ü§ñ. There are 2 approaches: 
1. Search for your Helium hotspot on the [map](https://app.hotspotty.net/hotspots) and go to the **Contact owner** tab where you will find the <button class="hotspotty-button">Verify wallet</button> button. From there you can follow the steps to [verify your helium wallet](../getting-started/add-your-helium-wallet#verify-wallet-ownership).

2. You can add your wallet to your [workspace](https://app.hotspotty.net/workspace/wallets) and verify it from there by clicking on the 3 dots aligned at the right of your wallet address.

## How to contact another hotspot owner?

First, [navigate to the desired hotspot](https://app.hotspotty.net/hotspots) you want to message the owner from. By then clicking on the **Contact owner** tab, you will be able to send a message to the owner who will then receive an email.

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è It is required to [verify](../getting-started/add-your-helium-wallet#verify-wallet-ownership) at least one wallet in the workspace to be able to contact others.

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è For the user to receive the message, the wallet containing this hotspot needs to be verified!

1. Whenever a hotspot belongs to a verified wallet, a <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="-3 -3 26 26" class="los-icon" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.267 3.455a3.066 3.066 0 001.745-.723 3.066 3.066 0 013.976 0 3.066 3.066 0 001.745.723 3.066 3.066 0 012.812 2.812c.051.643.304 1.254.723 1.745a3.066 3.066 0 010 3.976 3.066 3.066 0 00-.723 1.745 3.066 3.066 0 01-2.812 2.812 3.066 3.066 0 00-1.745.723 3.066 3.066 0 01-3.976 0 3.066 3.066 0 00-1.745-.723 3.066 3.066 0 01-2.812-2.812 3.066 3.066 0 00-.723-1.745 3.066 3.066 0 010-3.976 3.066 3.066 0 00.723-1.745 3.066 3.066 0 012.812-2.812zm7.44 5.252a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z" clip-rule="evenodd"></path></svg> icon will be displayed next to the name.

2. This is the number of messages sent to this hotspot. In case no one has claimed the hotspot/wallet yet, the messages will be placed on hold until the wallet is verified.

If someone is trying to reach out to you on your **verified hotspots**, you will receive an email notification, so don't worry about missing any messages.

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è This feature works best the more people are verified on hotspotty, so tell all your contacts to get verified!
