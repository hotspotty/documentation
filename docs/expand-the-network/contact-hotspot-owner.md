# Contact hotspot owner
Letting people contact you is a great way to improve the overall quality of the Helium network. Maybe someone wants to collaborate with you or wants to help you [improve your reward scale](../expand-the-network/optimize-your-earnings-and-reward-scaling)?
Or what if you are the person willing to help someone out?


## How to get contacted?
Verify your HNT wallet so that Hotspotty knows you are a human :smile:. There are 2 approaches: 
1. Search for your Helium hotspot on the [map](https://app.hotspotty.net/hotspots) and go to the 'Contact owner' tab where you will find the 'Verify wallet' button.
2. You can add your wallet in your [workspace](https://app.hotspotty.net/workspace/wallets) and verify it from there by clicking on the 3 dots aligned at the right of your wallet address.


## How to contact a hotspot owner?
First, [navigate to the desired hotspot](https://app.hotspotty.net/hotspots) you want to message the owner from. By then clicking on the 'Contact owner' tab, you will be able to send a message to the owner who will then receive an email.

Important to note is that Hotspotty also requires you to verify at least one wallet so that bots are not able to spam hosts.
