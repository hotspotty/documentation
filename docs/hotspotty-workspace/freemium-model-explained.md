# Free to freemium migration guide

Hotspotty will go live with its freemium model on **Mar 1, 2022**, which puts an end to the unlimited and free beta version that was launched mid August 2021. This document is meant to outline our new commercial offering and elaborate on some specific use cases.

## Freemium model explained

Most features in Hotspotty are free to use but with the implementation of the freemium model there will be some limitations. Extra features and increased limits are available through paid subscription plans.

### Workspaces

Everything billing-related is defined at a workspace level. So if you have a workspace with multiple team members collaborating, the billing details are configured for the entire workspace and not for each individual member.

This also means that you can be part of multiple workspaces that each have a different subscription plan associated with it.

### Base subscription plan

Each workspace needs to have one of the four base subscription plans:

- Hotspotty Community (FREE)
- Hotspotty Plus
- Hotspotty Pro
- Hotspotty Max

**Hotspotty Community** is the default for each workspace, and is free of charge but limited in use.

Hotspotty Plus, Hotspotty Pro and Hotspotty Max come with a monthly subscription fee that grants elevated limits and an expanded feature set.

Each plan comes with a limit of hotspots and simulations per month that is included. For the Hotspotty Community plan, the only way to surpass these limits is to upgrade to a paid base subscription plan. For the paid subscription plans, you can add more hotspots to your workspace and thus, exceed the included number of monthly simulations of the plan. This extra use is billed at an on-demand rate (see below), which can be decreased by prepaid volume discounts (see below).

### On-demand

> Note: This is not applicable to the free Hotspotty Community base plan.

All plans come with a defined quota of hotspots and simulations. For paid plans you can always add more hotspots and simulations which will be billed at an on-demand rate of $1 per extra hotspot or simulation. This is billed at the end of each billing cycle based on the usage during that month.

### Prepaid volume discounts

Users that expect to use significantly more hotspot or simulations than are included in their base subscription plan can benefit from volume discounts by allocating extra prepaid hotspots and simulations per month. This means that the workspace will have this extra capacity available which is now exempt from the on-demand rates (for use up to the allocated volume) and instead will be billed at a more favorable rate. These prepaid hotspots and simulations reset after every month, meaning that it is not possible to stack up and rollover to the following month. A healthy balance needs to be found by the user to achieve the most favorable combination of base subscription plan, prepaid usage and on-demand usage.
