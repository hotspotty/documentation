# Add a hotspot
You can always add a hotspot you want to follow to your workspace. 

This can be done either by adding a wallet that is associated with the hotspot or adding the individual hotspott. 

From your workspace navigate to the hotspot tab and click Add Hotspot in the top right corner. Search by hotspot name and tick the box if you want to add all hotspots associated with the wallet.

Alternatively, you can add a wallet and its associated hotspots. From your workspace navigate to the wallet tab and click add wallet in the top right corner. Tick the box to follow the hotspots associated with the wallet and save. Voila.
