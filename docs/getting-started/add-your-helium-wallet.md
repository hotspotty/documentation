From the main map view, click **Sign in with Discord** in the top right corner. If you do not have a Discord account, you will be asked to create one using your email.

After signing in with Discord, we advise that you add and verify your helium wallet. This will unlock access to a broader range of Hotspotty tools, e.g. help you plan your locations to ensure an even distribution of the Helium Network and in effect greatest earning potential for all.

Add your HNT wallet address and decide if you want to track all the hotspots associated with the HNT address. If not, untick the box. You can always add or remove individual hotspots associated with the wallet, should you decide not to track a selection of hotspots associated with a wallet.

## Verify wallet ownership

You can choose to verify your wallet either from your workspace or the Hotspotty map. [Here is how.](../expand-the-network/contact-hotspot-owner#how-to-get-contacted)

The process of actually verifying a wallet is very straight forward.

1. Check if you are going to verify the right wallet. The hotspots attached to the wallet are shown on the right.

2. You will need to make a small donation to the Hotspotty team. The minimum amount is 0.1 HNT, every donation larger than that is greatly appreciated and will help out the team to make more great content for the community!

3. A QR code is now generated and you have 24 hours the time in order to make the transaction by scanning the QR code using the Helium app. If the transaction is not made within 24 hours, you can start the process again.

4. Great! Your transaction is now pending and will automatically get approved by the Helium blockchain.
