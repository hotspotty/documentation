# Analytics dashboard

Unlock the dashboard analytics by connecting to Discord and veryfying your wallet. During wallet verification the standard setting is to track the hotspots associated with the wallet. 

If you navigate to the Wallets tab, you can add and remove wallets you want to track in your dashboard.  

The main dashboard displays total balance and gives you an option to filter by hotspot status and parameters such as transmit scale and install status.
