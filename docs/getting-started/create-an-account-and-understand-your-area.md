# Create an account and understand your area

Open Hotspotty from the main landing page and you'll see the map of your area and the positioning and status of the hotspots within it.  

You need to understand the fundamentals to read the map and get the most out of the Hotspotty analytics.

## Hotspots analytics in your area

Zoom in and out the map using the + / - symbols at the top right. When you zoom out sufficiently you will see the purple hex that defines the outter borders of the area that's analysed. You can move the purple hex or use the magnifing glass to search for specific locations, hotspots or contacts and the map will move to the desired location when you press enter.  


Every circle on the map represents a hotspot as registered in the Helium network. The color represents a hotspot's status within the network. 

Green - the hotspot is online and has an excellent transmit scale

Yellow - the hotspot is online and has a mediocre transmit scale 

Orange - the hotspot is online and has a poor transmit scale

Purple - the hotspot is offline or has recently been offline and is currently syncing

```
