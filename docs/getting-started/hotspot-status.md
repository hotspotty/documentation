# Hotspot status (in dev)

## Blockchain data
See the information of a hotspot directly pulled from the Helium blockchain. Please note that the blockchain data needs some time to update and can differ from the real time state.

**Online status** : *Online / Offline*

**Relay status**: *Relayed / Not relayed*

**Sync status**: *Synced / Syncing / Not syncing*
## Real time status check
By running a real time status check, the hotspot will receive a ping which then hopefully results in good data returning. Unlike the blockchain data, it will give you an up-to-date summary of the hotspot information.

In case your hotspot is relayed, you can use the 'Open port tester' to see if the correct ports are opened on your WiFi/Ethernet router so that the Helium hotspot is able to do its tasks. Not sure how to perform port forwarding for your Helium hotspot? Take a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UgDMG_g3qI&ab_channel=TarioSultan) video or contact your local ISP (Internet Service Provider) for more info.
