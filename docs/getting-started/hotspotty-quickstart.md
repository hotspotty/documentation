## Visualize & Understand

Importing wallets and hotspots is a great way to manage payouts, to keep track of transactions, to keep track of hotspot activity and so on. A lot of this info comes together in your personal dashboard or more detailed information regarding your hotspots can be viewed in the Advanced Hotspot overview tabs.

[Dashboard](https://app.hotspotty.net/workspace/dashboard) :

When it comes to visualizing and understanding data - the Hotspotty map is there to assist you. Take a look at hotspot data in your area using Hotspotty's Region Dashboard feature or go back in time and see how the OG's performed with Time Travel simulations.

## Planning and optimizing

Want to build out a network? Start by adding locations to your network and associate them with the associated contacts. Not sure where to place a new hotspot? Try out our location transmit scale simulations and learn all about the Helium network.

Use the Line of Sight tool to view possible obstacles that can prevent your hotspot of earning more. This includes buildings, mountains, terrain, ...

## Monitoring and managing

Monitor hotspot info closely. Get info about rewards, witnesses, beacons, challengers, antenna gain, ...
On top of that you can perform real time checks to see if a hotspot is behaving online/offline or might be relayed. The difference with the blockchain data is that real time checks are updated live and are not delayed.

Manage your installs in your workspace. Installs represent locations where a hotspot is/was installed. This comes in very handy to set up commission reports.

Use labels to organize all your data and filter for default labels or labels created by yourself.

## Team & Community Collaboration

Collaborate with others in your workspace by adding them as a member or admin. Add data together and keep of track of one another by adding comments. Comments can only be viewed by team members and are workspace-bound. Easily @ collaborators so that they receive an email.

Looking for hosts in an area to connect with? Choose the correct hex and join the Discord server.
