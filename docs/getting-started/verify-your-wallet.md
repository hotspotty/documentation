From the main map view, click sign in with Discord in the top right corner. If you do not have a Discord account you will be asked to create one. Create one using your email. 

Following this we advise that you verify your HNT wallet. This will unlock access to a broader range of Hotspotty tools eg. help you plan your locations to ensure an even distribution of the Helium Network and in effect greatest earning potential for all.
