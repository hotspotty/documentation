From the main map view, click sign in with Discord in the top right corner. If you do not have a Discord account, you will be asked to create one. Create one using your email.

After you sign in with Discord, we advise that you verify your HNT wallet. This will unlock access to a broader range of Hotspotty tools, e.g. help you plan your locations to ensure an even distribution of the Helium Network and in effect greatest earning potential for all.

Add your HNT wallet address and decide if you want to track all the hotspots associated with the HNT address. If not, uncheck the box. You can always add or remove individual hotspots associated with the wallet, should you decide not to track a selection of hotspots associated with a wallet.
